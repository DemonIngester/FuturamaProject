    <h3>Galactic Dispatch Directives: Our Shipping Policies</h3>
    <h4>1. Interstellar Parcel Authorization</h4>
    <p>Customers utilizing Planet Express services
    for shipping packages across the cosmos are
    required to provide accurate details regarding
    the contents of their shipments. All items
    must comply with universal shipping regulations,
    including but not limited to restricted substances,
    hazardous materials, and items prohibited by 
    intergalactic law. Failure to disclose accurate
    information may result in delays, confiscation,
    or refusal of delivery.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Temporal and Spatial Delivery Windows</h4>
    <p>While we endeavor to maintain precise delivery 
    schedules, customers are advised that temporal and 
    spatial anomalies occasionally affect delivery times. 
    Estimated delivery windows are calculated based on standard 
    cosmic conditions; however, unforeseen disruptions such as 
    wormholes, time eddies, or cosmic rifts might cause deviations. 
    Planet Express will make every effort to adhere to scheduled delivery 
    times and communicate any anticipated delays caused by extraterrestrial 
    phenomena.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Intergalactic Delivery Charges</h4>
    <p>Planet Express operates on a fair and transparent pricing
     policy for interstellar deliveries. Charges are calculated 
     based on distance, weight, dimensionality, and any specialized 
     handling required for unique items. Additional fees may apply for 
     deliveries to remote or hazardous locations, alternate dimensions, 
     or civilizations with differing currency standards. Customers will 
     receive a detailed breakdown of charges before finalizing their shipments.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Quantum Signature Verification</h4>
    <p>To ensure the safe and accurate delivery of packages, recipients
    must be present to verify their quantum signature upon receipt.
    This process involves confirming the recipient's identity through 
    a quantum entanglement interface, ensuring that the package reaches 
    the intended recipient and maintaining security during transit. 
    In the event of absence, alternative arrangements for secure package
    retrieval can be made through our customer care department.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Package Insurance and Liability</h4>
    <p>Customers have the option to purchase insurance for their 
    interstellar shipments to safeguard against unforeseen circumstances
    such as cosmic incidents, dimensional fluctuations, or encounters
    with space pirates. Planet Express assumes limited liability for
    packages in transit, and insurance coverage offers additional 
    protection against loss, damage, or theft during delivery. Customers
    are encouraged to inquire about insurance options for their valuable 
    or delicate items.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Customer Service and Galactic Support</h4>
    <p>Our customer service representatives are available across timelines
    and celestial coordinates to assist with any inquiries, tracking requests,
    or concerns regarding shipments. Customers can access our galactic support 
    network through various communication channels to receive updates on their 
    deliveries, report any issues, or seek resolution for any delivery-related 
    matters.
